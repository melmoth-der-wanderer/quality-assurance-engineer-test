# Quality Assurance engineer test
Welcome to the QA Engineer tech test. We expect the work to take around 1 to 1.5 hours, and we thank
you in advance for taking that time for us!

This test consists of two parts: a written part and a coding part. For the written part, we would
like to receive a PDF, slide presentation or MD file with your insights. For the coding part, a fork of this repo with
your solution will do.

### Automated Testing Assignment
You can fork (and then clone your own version of) this repo and run:

```
$ python -m http.server 8000
```

You now have a working frontend app that you will write some kind of automated user acceptence tests for.
The language of framework you use does not matter, but we prefer JS, PHP or Python.
